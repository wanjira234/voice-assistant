# Jarvis - Voice-Controlled Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant that listens to voice commands, performs tasks like playing music, telling the time, searching for information, and more. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with users.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Activate Jarvis by saying the wake word "Jarvis".
- **Play Music**: Ask Jarvis to play any song on YouTube.
- **Get the Time and Date**: Ask for the current time or today's date.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Ask "Who is [someone]" or "What is [something]" and get a summary from Wikipedia.
- **Small Talk**: Jarvis can respond to common phrases like "How are you?" or "What is your name?"
- **End the Session**: Say "stop" to terminate the program.

## Requirements

To run Jarvis, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `speechrecognition`: For recognizing speech from the microphone.
- `pyttsx3`: For converting text to speech.
- `pywhatkit`: For playing YouTube videos.
- `datetime`: For fetching the current time and date.
- `wikipedia`: For fetching summaries from Wikipedia.
- `pyaudio`: Required for microphone access (might need to be installed separately depending on your platform).

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia pyaudio
